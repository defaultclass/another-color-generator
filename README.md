# Another Color Generator

Simply generate two colors that you can influence using the options provided; red, green and blue;

## Influence

These options will increase the value of the corresponding red, green or blue value and therefore returning results closer to that color.

You can set the first and second color individually so play around with the options.

## Gradient

The two colors will automatically create a linear gradient in a top-down direction. This can be changed using ths range slider.
